# Employee_Database_Challenge.sql
So, Pewlett-Hackard is about to have a lot of people retire from their company, therefore creating a lot of vacancy for positions within the company.  So, what we're doing is keeping track of all the employees of retirement age and all the positions that are going to need to be filled.  So I took the databases and narrowed down my query using MYSQL.  So, then with that information, I also had to go and see if we can have a mentorship program going to prepare fo the wave of employees that will be retiring and help the company run without much issues.

One thing I noticed is that there are a lot of people retiring from the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions.  That takes up almost double the rest of the positions of people retiring as a whole.  As a result, this Pewlett-Hackard needs to figure out how to run their company after having a huge wave of approx. 80,000 employees all retiring.  Ergo, the mentorship program.  While there are more people retiring than could be mentors, we still have plenty of mentors who can help teach people, as well as learn from the retirees to keep the company afloat.
